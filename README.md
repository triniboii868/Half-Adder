# Binary Addition
Binary addition is somewhat similar to regular addition, but a tad different. It is similar in the way that they are added from the rightmost 
place value to the leftmost place value. The difference comes where the values can only contain 0's and 1's instead of 0-9 in regular addition. 

## How to do Addition in Binary.
0 + 0 = 0 → Nothing changes, just like in normal math.
0 + 1 or 1 + 0 = 1 → Adding 1 to 0 is still just 1, no surprises there.
1 + 1 = 10 → This is where binary is different. In decimal, 1 + 1 is 2, but since binary only has 0 and 1, there’s no "2." Instead, we write 0 
and carry over a 1 to the next column, just like how 5 + 5 in decimal makes 10, and you carry the 1. So, binary addition is similar to regular 
addition but with carrying happening sooner— whenever you reach 2 instead of 10.

# Half-Adder, what is it?
A half adder is basically a digital logic circuit that adds two single-bit binary numbers, for instance the examples given above. These adders
start wiith two binary inputs which subsequently produce a "sum" output, denoted by S, and a "carry" output denoted by C<sup>out</sup>. 
The sum bit represents the least significant bit of the addition and the carry-out bit of 0 or 1.
